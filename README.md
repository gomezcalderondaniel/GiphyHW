Synopsis:
This app is designed for fun and entertainment. Buttons are generated with some of my favorite Saturday Night Live(SNL) characters of all time. On-click of the buttons various animated GIFs are generated. On-click of the generated images, they transition from static to active state.

Motivation:
SNL is one of my favorite shows of all-time, and I wanted to create something light and fun.
